I am a 5th-year PhD student at the <a href="https://www.mpi-sws.org/">Max Planck Institute for Software Systems</a>, where I work under the guidance of Dr. <a href="https://people.mpi-sws.org/~gradanovic/index.html">Goran Radanovic</a>. My research interests encompass causality, (multi-agent) reinforcement learning and algorithmic game theory. Currently, I am focusing on accountable multi-agent sequential decision making and quantifying agents' impact on decision outcomes. 

Before embarking on my doctoral journey, I obtained my diploma in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the <a href="https://www.ntua.gr/en/">National Technical University of Athens</a>. During this time, I had the chance to work on my diploma thesis under the mentorship of Prof. <a href="http://www.softlab.ntua.gr/~fotakis/">Dimitris Fotakis</a>.
